# Rain-Detection-Wiper-System

This is an **analog and embedded system project** that implements a **rain-sensing wiper control circuit**. It intelligently adjusts the speed of a **DC motor-driven wiper** based on the **intensity of rainfall**, ensuring optimal visibility and energy efficiency.

The system includes both **analog and digital components**, with a real-time **Arduino-based speedometer** to monitor wiper speed.

## Features

- Detects rain intensity using a **rain sensor**
- Automatically adjusts wiper speed via **MOSFET control**
- Provides back-and-forth wiper motion using an **H-Bridge circuit**
- Displays real-time wiper speed using **Arduino and IR sensor**
- Indicates speed using **LEDs**
- Combines **analog signal processing** with **microcontroller-based control**
